Hello!

I'm Gowtham and welcome to my page. While all my other thoughts in and about my life go in my diary(yeah if only!), I consider this page mostly to be about technology and my computer science related knowledge. You see, CS as whole is like the universe. How much ever you explore there is always that tiny speck of dust or an entire planet unexplored and then its a whole news thing suddenly. There are problems that are known to mankind which were intended to have been solved since decades but here we are without the solutions, aren't we?

So I explored my part of it and I kind of have specifics but I also don't. One of my friends asked me if I wanted to be a part of the process involving the making of the Iron Man suit rather than just looking at RDJ in awe. Some concepts in technology look like magic but I've been told(and I believe too) that there are always patterns and nothing happens without a reason. But if you deep dive into anything and everything, often times the mystery is gone.

I surf in the shallow waters of backend technologies, databases and access control policies.
My personal favourite tech stack is Go, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes on the Linux environment. However I have worked with NodeJS and a couple of its frameworks. I've written large middleware modules for Express in my work. I've designed and developed small/random Flutter apps so I'm no expert.
I've worked with graph databases like Neo4J for my graduation thesis (you know how they be) but that's about it.

When I'm free, I take photos, try editing RAW photographs on Photoshop and creating digital art on Adobe Illustrator. I've released a sticker pack of [The Office](http://sticker.ly/s/518NPY) whilst learning digital art. Don't forget to check them out if you're a fan of the show!
