### Hello there! :grinning:

I'm Gowtham and I have a Masters degree in Comp. Science from IIITDM, Kancheepuram. I’m highly interested in backend and server technologies and have a fair amount of experience. I work in Linux and am far more efficient in it compared to other platforms.

More about me? I generally checkout the latest technologies in open source and blogs regarding the tech giants. Most of my projects are based on performance improvisation, scalable and backend layers related to the Go programming language. I’m experienced in writing production level code in Golang, thanks to my previous internships in supporting me build my skills in it. I’m self motivated and try to learn new technologies, cloud platforms and programming languages to keep myself busy in the zone.

I work at [Skuad](https://www.skuad.io/) where I build the next generation software to build, pay, manage globally distributed teams.

Checkout my blog at [g14a.github.io](https://g14a.github.io/)

Ping me on my email ID to suggest work opportunites or for hire. I'm always looking forward to work with wonderful collaborators.
